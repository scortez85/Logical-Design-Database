SR Database Explorer

Usage: Window -> SoftRare -> Database Explorer

There are 2 tabs: Settings and Explorer

In the Settings tab you configure to what database you want to connect. Currently you can connect to MySQL and SQLITE databases. In the case of SQLITE databases it is also possible to create them with native functionality of this package. 

In the Explorer tab you can choose which table to view and even execute your own queries right on the database itsself. Updates are instantly refreshed and viewable.

This package we gift to you for free as promotional effort to make you aware of our new ORM package we are in the final stages of releasing ( ORM = Object-Relational Mapping, for reference see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping ). Please feel free to ask us for info!

Have fun!
